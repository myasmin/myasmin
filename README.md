#  👋 Hi, I’m Mahmuda Yasmin, an aspiring Data Scientist.
 
 I’m interested in Machine Learning, Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modelling. I work with Data Modelling, e.g. Statistical and Machine Learning Models.
💹 I have 6+ years of working experince as a Data Visualization Analyst.
🌱 I’m currently working on projects written in Python and R, and just enough of SQL to pull Data for my Analysis.
- 💞️ I’m open for a career switch as a Data Scientist.  I am looking for any kind of opportunities and to collaborate on interesting projects. Some of the Datasets make sense and some of them don't. So, I think it's fun to try to find out which is the best way to work for future prediction.
- ❤️ I love reading books, photography and spending time with my two kids!
