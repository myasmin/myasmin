 👋 Hi, I’m @myasmin
- 👀 I’m interested in Statistical Analysis and Predictive Modelling. I work with Data Modelling, e.g. Statistical and Machine Learning Models.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on projects written in Python and R, and just enough of SQL to pull Data for my Analysis. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects. Some of the Datasets make sense and some of them don't. So, I think it's fun to try to find out which is the best way to work for future prediction.
- ❤️ I love reading books, photography and spending time with my two kids!
